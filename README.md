# Beeoids
#2021
Beeoids is a boid (flocking behavior) script written in C# attached to a Unity particle system. The script tracks each particle in the particle system array and tells it where to go based on its current target, the weight at which it seeks that target as well as alignment, separation, and cohesion with other boids. Beeoids may lose interest in their current target and can randomly select a new target to seek out.
